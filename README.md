# Renewable Energy


![US-Renewable-Energy-Prediction](Images/US_Renewable_Energy_map.png)




### Description:

For this project, we used machine learning to predict the difference between a state's energy demand and its renewable energy production 1, 5, and 10 years from the present. 


### Questions:

* How renewable energy production will change in the US by state?
 
* Predict a state's ability to meet its Energy Consumption needs with Renewable Energy Production.

## Analysis

* Clean and modify the data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

* Use Heroku and PostgreSQL as the database.

* Use Python as the server side language, Flask as the web server and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end.

* Use Linear Regression model for machine learning.

* Use D3, Plotly and Leaflet to visualize the data.
